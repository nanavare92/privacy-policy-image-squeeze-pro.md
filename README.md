Image Squeeze Pro

Last updated: 1st Jan 2026

Image Squeeze Pro (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how our Android application Image Squeeze Pro handles user information.

1. Information We Collect
1.1 Personal Information

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information such as name, email address, phone number, or account details.

1.2 Images and Media

Images selected by the user are accessed only for the purpose of compression or resizing.

All image processing happens locally on your device.

Images are never uploaded to any server or shared with us or third parties.

1.3 Automatically Collected Information

We do not collect device identifiers, location data, contact lists, or browsing history.

2. Permissions Used

Image Squeeze Pro uses the following permissions only when required:

Photo Picker / Media Access
Used to allow users to select images for compression and resizing.

Storage Access (MediaStore)
Used only to save the processed images back to your device.

No permission is used to track users or collect personal data.

3. Data Processing & Storage

All image compression and resizing is performed offline on your device.

The app does not store any user data on external servers.

Processed images are saved only to the location chosen by the user.

4. Metadata (EXIF Data)

By default, image metadata such as EXIF information may be preserved.

Users can choose to remove metadata, including location data, before saving images.

Image Squeeze Pro does not read or use metadata for tracking purposes.

5. Third-Party Services
Advertising (if applicable)

If the free version of Image Squeeze Pro displays ads:

Ads may be served by Google AdMob or similar advertising partners.

These services may collect anonymous, non-personal data as per their own privacy policies.

You can review Google’s Privacy Policy here:

The app itself does not have access to or control over data collected by third-party ad services.

6. Children’s Privacy

Image Squeeze Pro does not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13.
Since the app does not collect personal information, it is safe for general audiences.

7. Data Security

We implement standard Android security best practices.

Since no personal data is collected or stored, the risk of data misuse is minimized.

8. User Rights

Because Image Squeeze Pro does not collect or store personal data:

There is no personal data to access, modify, or delete.

Users maintain full control over their images at all times.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be reflected with an updated “Last updated” date.
